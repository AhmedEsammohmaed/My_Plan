# CS Roadmap

# introduction
1- All main topics of Computer science are covered in this roadmap (from basics till interview)

2-Roadamp is divided int 5 levels (0-->4)

3-Know your level and join to it

# Resources :
+ The main resource for studing is [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) -> covered all Computer science topics .
+ The main resource for problem solving is [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/)
+ You can use any other resource for studing and problem solving , it's up to you
